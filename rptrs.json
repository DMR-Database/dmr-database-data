This repeater is located on Mt. Vaca between the cities of Vacaville and Napa California at 2,760 feet.<br><br>Welcome to the K6LNK / CARLA DMR Repeater Network.<br><br>The main goal and purpose of K6LNK / CARLA analog and DMR repeaters is to provide reliable communications resource during significant local, regional and wide area incidents. This K6LNK / CARLA DMR repeater is connected to BrandMeister Master Server 3103. The Talk Groups and Clusters that are currently static on Time Slots 1 & 2 have been placed there to best meet the goals of CARLA. These static Talk Groups may change at times to meet our goals. We realize and understand that DMR in the BrandMeister environment affords the end user (YOU) many opportunities to add whatever Talk Group to whichever Time Slot that you desire. In the best interest of meeting CARLA goals and being able to serve agencies and organizations communication needs during times of significant area incidents we would ask that you operate within the current static Talk Group matrix on the K6LNK repeaters. In many if not most of the locations where K6LNK / CARLA DMR repeaters are located other DMR repeaters exist to meet your dynamic Talk Group needs.<br><br>This means that we would strongly prefer that you NOT add ANY dynamic Talk Groups to either Time Slot. We are particularly NOT interested in having the following Talk Groups dynamically activated by YOU at any time 91, 93, 3100, TAC-3XX, any off US shore T/G, and any special interest T/G.<br><br>We strongly believe that all DMR repeaters are not personal hot spots and should not be treated as such. The Talk Groups and Clusters that are currently static on Time Slots 1 & 2 have been placed there to best meet the goals of CARLA.<br><br>Thank you for your help and support in assisting CARLA to meet our goals and in our endeavor to support local, regional and wide area agency communications needs in times of significant incidents.

Vacaville, California. This repeater is located on Mt. Vaca between the cities of Vacaville and Napa California at 2,760 feet.<br><br>Welcome to the K6LNK / CARLA DMR Repeater Network.<br><br>The main goal and purpose of K6LNK / CARLA analog and DMR repeaters is to provide reliable communications resource during significant local, regional and wide area incidents. This K6LNK / CARLA DMR repeater is connected to BrandMeister Master Server 3103. The Talk Groups and Clusters that are currently static on Time Slots 1 & 2 have been placed there to best meet the goals of CARLA. These static Talk Groups may change at times to meet our goals. We realize and understand that DMR in the BrandMeister environment affords the end user (YOU) many opportunities to add whatever Talk Group to whichever Time Slot that you desire. In the best interest of meeting CARLA goals and being able to serve agencies and organizations communication needs during times of significant area incidents we would ask that you operate within the current static Talk Group matrix on the K6LNK repeaters. In many if not most of the locations where K6LNK / CARLA DMR repeaters are located other DMR repeaters exist to meet your dynamic Talk Group needs.<br><br>This means that we would strongly prefer that you NOT add ANY dynamic Talk Groups to either Time Slot. We are particularly NOT interested in having the following Talk Groups dynamically activated by YOU at any time 91, 93, 3100, TAC-3XX, any off US shore T/G, and any special interest T/G.<br><br>We strongly believe that all DMR repeaters are not personal hot spots and should not be treated as such. The Talk Groups and Clusters that are currently static on Time Slots 1 & 2 have been placed there to best meet the goals of CARLA.<br><br>Thank you for your help and support in assisting CARLA to meet our goals and in our endeavor to support local, regional and wide area agency communications needs in times of significant incidents.

This repeater is located on Mt. Vaca between the cities of Vacaville and Napa California at 2,760 feet.<br><br>Welcome to the K6LNK / CARLA DMR Repeater Network.<br><br>The main goal and purpose of K6LNK / CARLA analog and DMR repeaters is to provide reliable communications resource during significant local, regional and wide area incidents. This K6LNK / CARLA DMR repeater is connected to BrandMeister Master Server 3103. The Talk Groups and Clusters that are currently static on Time Slots 1 & 2 have been placed there to best meet the goals of CARLA. These static Talk Groups may change at times to meet our goals. We realize and understand that DMR in the BrandMeister environment affords the end user (YOU) many opportunities to add whatever Talk Group to whichever Time Slot that you desire. In the best interest of meeting CARLA goals and being able to serve agencies and organizations communication needs during times of significant area incidents we would ask that you operate within the current static Talk Group matrix on the K6LNK repeaters. In many if not most of the locations where K6LNK / CARLA DMR repeaters are located other DMR repeaters exist to meet your dynamic Talk Group needs.<br><br>This means that we would strongly prefer that you NOT add ANY dynamic Talk Groups to either Time Slot. We are particularly NOT interested in having the following Talk Groups dynamically activated by YOU at any time 91, 93, 3100, TAC-3XX, any off US shore T/G, and any special interest T/G.<br><br>We strongly believe that all DMR repeaters are not personal hot spots and should not be treated as such. The Talk Groups and Clusters that are currently static on Time Slots 1 & 2 have been placed there to best meet the goals of CARLA.<br><br>Thank you for your help and support in assisting CARLA to meet our goals and in our endeavor to support local, regional and wide area agency communications needs in times of significant incidents.
